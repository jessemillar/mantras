# Remote Work

## Resources

- The Basecamp people also wrote a [Guide to Internal Communication](https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate) to help everyone (remote workers included) stay in sync
	- Learning how to communicate is paramount to any job
	- Most communication these days is asynchronous
	- The more long-form documentation you have, the less meetings there are
		- "Meetings are the last resort, not the first option"
	- Never expect someone to get back to you immediately; this can create a toxic culture where people are glued to their chat windows
	- Poor communication (and by extension, poor or lacking documentation) results in more work
	- "Five people in a room for an hour isn't a one hour meeting, it's a five hour meeting. Be mindful of the tradeoffs"
	- Think before you speak (and sleep on it if needed)
	- "If you want an answer, you have to ask a question"
	- "If something's going to be difficult to hear or share, invite questions at the end. Ending without the invitation will lead to public silence but private conjecture. This is where rumors breed."
	- "Ask if things are clear. Ask what you left out. Ask if there was anything someone was expecting that you didn't cover. Address the gaps before they widen with time."
	- "Consider where you put things. The right communication in the wrong place might as well not exist at all. When someone relies on search to find something it's often because it wasn't where they expected something to be."
	- "Keeping people in the loop is important, but asking them to follow along with everything is a distraction."
	- "Writing up what you did every day is a great way to think back about what you accomplished and how you spent your time."
- https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems
	- "Group chat is like being in an all-day meeting, with random participants, and no agenda."
	- "People talk about some work in the chat room and nobody objects. That leads people to assume everyone read that discussion and agreed. Except that they weren't, or they didn't."
	- "At Basecamp our perfect-world rule of thumb is "real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time"."
	- Stop expecting everyone to be in chat all day long. Don't set an expectation that people should have a chat window open all day. Make chat something you bounce into and out of purposefully, not stick around all day.
	- If it's important, slow down. If it's an important conversation, it shouldn't happen in the chat room. Chat should be about quick, ephemeral things. Important topics need time, traction, and separation from the rest of the chatter.
	- Announcements aren't chats. Related to the point above, if you have to make a company/group-wide announcement you need to make sure everyone sees, don't post it in the chat room. Send it asynchronously.
	- Tell people to "write it up" instead. Stuck in a chat that's going on way too long? Talking a lot but not making progress? Stop the conversation and ask someone to "write it up" — take it to long-form, make it asynchronous. Let someone make a complete point all at once and then give people time to absorb it and respond in kind, over time.
	- Set expectations that it's OK to be unavailable.
	- "Understanding the positives and negatives [of chat], and how they play off one another, is central to getting the most out of something. Knowing the tradeoffs helps you assign value. Ignoring the cons because the pros are so good, or dismissing the pros because the cons are so bad, leaves you with a false sense of comfort and a cloudy picture of the reality on the ground."
	- "There are lots of managers out there who love group chat because they can pop-in-and-out quickly and speak to many people at once, but there are a lot of employees out there sweating all day long trying to keep up appearances of being involved but knowing they have actual work to do. They can't stop thinking about how they're going to have to work late. They can't stop thinking about how the constant distractions during the week days means that Sunday night now belongs to their job. It's absolutely a real problem."
	- "It's common in the software industry to blame the users. It's the user's fault. They don't know how to use it. They're using it wrong. They need to do this or do that. But the reality is that tools encourage specific behaviors. A product is a series of design decisions with a specific outcome in mind. Yes, you can use tools as they weren't intended, but most people follow the patterns suggested by the design. And so in the end, if people are exhausted and feeling unable to keep up, it's the tool's fault, not the user's fault. If the design leads to stress, it's a bad design."

## Notes

- Turn your video on in every meeting to help people know who you are and to show that you're paying attention in the meeting
	- I've heard people say that when meeting attendees don't have their video enabled, it's easy to think that everyone is either not listening or they're upset with whatever you're saying
- If you're a manager and you are trying to "appreciate" your employees with some sort of perk (e.g. free sandwiches in the break room, a membership to the local virtual golf club, etc.), please try to remember that you have remote employees. If you blast out an email about a perk to everyone (remote people included) and the remote person can't participate because of distance and you make no attempt at including them, it demoralizes instead of motivates. The solution to this is *not* a separate email distribution list for only the local employees. If you're giving out perks, you have to give them out at the same time to different groups (e.g. sandwiches in the break room and a Grubhub gift card for the remote people).
