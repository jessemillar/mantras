# Remote Work

## Resources

- The Basecamp people also wrote a [Guide to Internal Communication](https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate) to help everyone (remote workers included) stay in sync
	- Learning how to communicate is paramount to any job
	- Most communication these days is asynchronous
	- The more long-form documentation you have, the less meetings there are
		- "Meetings are the last resort, not the first option"
	- Never expect someone to get back to you immediately; this can create a toxic culture where people are glued to their chat windows
	- Poor communication (and by extension, poor or lacking documentation) results in more work
	- "Five people in a room for an hour isn't a one hour meeting, it's a five hour meeting. Be mindful of the tradeoffs"
	- Think before you speak (and sleep on it if needed)
	- "If you want an answer, you have to ask a question"
	- "If something's going to be difficult to hear or share, invite questions at the end. Ending without the invitation will lead to public silence but private conjecture. This is where rumors breed."
	- "Ask if things are clear. Ask what you left out. Ask if there was anything someone was expecting that you didn't cover. Address the gaps before they widen with time."
	- "Consider where you put things. The right communication in the wrong place might as well not exist at all. When someone relies on search to find something it's often because it wasn't where they expected something to be."
	- "Keeping people in the loop is important, but asking them to follow along with everything is a distraction."
	- "Writing up what you did every day is a great way to think back about what you accomplished and how you spent your time."
