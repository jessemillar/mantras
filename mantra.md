I don't get this article, the author identifies the issue immediately:
> in the process, we often lose sight of the business problems being solved

And then goes on tangents as to why that is happening finally arriving on what tantamounts to "developers don't like to use visual UI tools".

The original cause identified is right, people lose sight of business goals, but why? Because they have poor project management and they are in the trenches all day long. They want to do right by the code base, so they abstract things which don't need to be abstracted. The failure here is one of trade off analysis and again losing sight of what is important, shipping a usable product which meets business goals.

At the end of the day, the goal of software development is to ship something that's usable. Usable defines functionality on the part of the client/customer and providing sanity to developers who have to develop and maintain said software.

You can't be involved in every aspect of a project. There's just not enough time in the day. In the wise words of my father-in-law, "You do what you can do, if it's what you can do, and that's all you can do."

In general, strive for best, not just good.

You have to take care of yourself if you want your work life to be healthy. We're only human after all.
