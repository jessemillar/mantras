I don't get this article, the author identifies the issue immediately:
> in the process, we often lose sight of the business problems being solved

And then goes on tangents as to why that is happening finally arriving on what tantamounts to "developers don't like to use visual UI tools".

The original cause identified is right, people lose sight of business goals, but why? Because they have poor project management and they are in the trenches all day long. They want to do right by the code base, so they abstract things which don't need to be abstracted. The failure here is one of trade off analysis and again losing sight of what is important, shipping a usable product which meets business goals.

At the end of the day, the goal of software development is to ship something that's usable. Usable defines functionality on the part of the client/customer and providing sanity to developers who have to develop and maintain said software.

You can't be involved in every aspect of a project. There's just not enough time in the day. In the wise words of my father-in-law, "You do what you can do, if it's what you can do, and that's all you can do."

In general, strive for best, not just good.

You have to take care of yourself if you want your work life to be healthy. We're only human after all.

**Always** ask lots of questions and do your research, especially if you're embarking on a project on your own. There's a decent chance that someone has already accomplished what you're hoping to. Don't duplicate effort unnecessarily.


Before you say "if you interrupt a developer its actually really hard for them to focus again"

Remember the same applies for anyone doing any job.

Thanks,

Everyone else.

It's been said before, but reminder:
As a developer, your job isn't to write code.  It's to understand a complex system of human wants and technological realities, and know how to solve problems in that system. Code is a side effect.

Think about Kaylee from Firefly. She kept Serenity flying and functional, but it maybe wasn't the prettiest at times. The functionality and reliability is what mattered, not the art of the engineering.

Perfect code should be appreciated and analyzed, but not necessarily pushed for when there's no immediate benefit (there may be a benefit, but it might be fleeting or not worth the effort)
