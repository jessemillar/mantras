# Management

I'm not a manager, but who's to say I won't be some day? This file represents some loose thoughts and resources for things relating to managers and team leading.

## Resources

- [A mega list of 1 on 1 meeting questions/discussion points](https://github.com/VGraupera/1on1-questions/blob/master/README.md)

## Notes

- Attempt to identify fractured situations where multiple people potentially want multiple, uncommunicated/unthought-of things and get everyone on the same page at the beginning of the project
- An iterative approach is the preferred method of software development, but everyone involved in the project needs to be aware of what the iteration plan is so someone isn't confused at the end why their idea of completion wasn't met
- If you're a manager and you are trying to "appreciate" your employees with some sort of perk (e.g. free sandwiches in the break room, a membership to the local virtual golf club, etc.), please try to remember that you have remote employees. If you blast out an email about a perk to everyone (remote people included) and the remote person can't participate because of distance and you make no attempt at including them, it demoralizes instead of motivates. The solution to this is *not* a separate email distribution list for only the local employees. If you're giving out perks, you have to give them out at the same time to different groups (e.g. sandwiches in the break room and a Grubhub gift card for the remote people).
