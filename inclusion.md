	- "Understand the limits of your own perspective. Be alert to the different kinds of unconscious and systemic biases that can make others feel excluded. We can't "catch" ourselves being biased, so we need to continuously be aware of the fact that we have biases we don't see and take steps to mitigate them."
	- "Human beings have a natural urge to quickly judge ideas, behaviors, and perspectives, even, or perhaps especially, when those relate to things that haven't been tried before. Exercising curiosity is to keep an open mind and exercise empathyâ€”an active interest in learning another person's thoughts, feelings, and condition from their point of view rather than from one's own. Growth mindset and humility help us value these perspectives of others and be more willing to change one's mind when presented with new information."
