# Productivity

## General

- Learn how to manage your own procrastination habits
	- Using a Pomodoro timer has helped me quite a bit
- I personally use a Bullet Journal to stay organized and focused
- When starting with a new code base, going through and making comment-only PRs is a great way to increase code readability/documentation while getting used to things

## Programming

- Documentation is crucially important, especially if you want new hires or outside collaborators to be able to jump in and assist in a timely manner
  - Incorrect or outdated documentation does more harm than nonexistent documentation
